README - This file.
HalfAdder.hdl - Adds two bits and outputs the sum and carry
FullAdder.hdl - Adds three bits and outputs the sum and carry
Add16.hdl - Adds two 16-bit integer numbers
Inc16.hdl - Increments a 16-bit number
ALU.hdl - The Arithmetic Logic Unit
ShiftLeft.hdl - Multiplies a 16-bit input number by 2 (ignoring overflow)
ShiftRight.hdl - Devides a 16-bit input number by 2 without remainder
Mul.hdl - Multiplies two 16-bit numbers.

Remarks
-------
* The multiplication chip was implemented according to long-multiplication algorithm
  where multiplication of each two bits x,y is just the And(x,y) operation.
  This method's shortcoming is the negative overflowing results which turns very small
  negative numbers to positive.
  Nonetheless, this method works well on the supplied test and in the exercise forum
  it is clearly written that it is sufficient.
* All other chips had simple implementations that were drawn directly from the lectures
  and simple logic.
