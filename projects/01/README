Remarks
-------
* We added two gates in order to simplify the implementation of more complex chips.
  Those chips are the 16-bit Nand gate with which we were able to implement most of the multi-bit chips
  just like the single-bit versions, and the Not1to16 that helped mainly with the complex Mux chip 
  (specifically, dealing with the multi-bit data inputs vs. single-bit sel input).
