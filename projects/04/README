README		-	This file.
Mult.asm		-	multiplies RAM[0] times RAM[1]
Fill.asm		-	colors the screen black when the keybourd is pressed
Sort.asm		-	Sorts the a bus of memory by decending order
Divide.asm		-	the floor of RAM[13] by RAM[14]

Remarks
-------
* To implement the multiplacation and devision methods we used 
the shift and add algorithm that works in time complexity of O(log(n)).
* To multiply we used the shiftLeft to multply the first number 
by 2 each time until 2^n > second number.then add the first 
number until 2^(n-1) + k = second number.
* To devide we multplied the second number the same way until the 
product > first number. The quotient is the number of times we 
multiplied the second number.
* Sorting was made using Bubble sort.
